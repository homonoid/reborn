Reborn is a work-in-progress implementation of the Apparat programming language in Ruby.

# Source

I am trying to keep the source compact but readable, so balancing on the edge and trying not to fail the second!

# Progress

Only the scanner part is working right now, and it can:

- [x] Scan identifiers and keywords.
- [x] Scan operators, symbols and parentheses.
- [ ] Scan ASCII.
- [ ] Scan text.
